My name is Jon Miller. I'm a software developer living near Boulder, Colorado and this is my development blog. I primarily develop in the Java ecosystem, but am always expanding my knowledge of additional web development technologies.

I am not sure exactly what I'll capture on this blog. Truthfully, I'm initially starting it mainly to learn about static site generators (in this case, [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com)).
